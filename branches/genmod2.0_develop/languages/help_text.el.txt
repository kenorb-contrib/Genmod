You can, more or less, compare it with the differences between 25ASA - 200ASA - 800ASA of conventional photographs.<br />The higher the resolution, the better the quality, but also the bigger the size of the files.<br />Normally for a picture on the web, 75 dpi is good enough.<br /><br /><b>Colour depth</b><br />The third way to keep a file small, is to decrease the number of colours that you use.<br />The numbers of colours can differ from pure black and white till true colours and anything in between.<br />Again you can imagine that the more colours are used, the bigger the size of the files.<br /><br /><b>Why is it important to keep the file size small?</b><br /><br />First of all: Our webspace is limmited.<br />The more large files, the more web space we need on the server. The more space we need, the more money we have to pay for it.<br /><br />Download time. If you have large files, the user (also you) will have to wait long for the page to download from the server.<br />Not everybody is blessed with a cable connection, broadband or DSL.<br /><br /><b>How to upload your MM</b><br />Well, to be short: you can't.<br />Because of all reasons, mentioned above, you can not directly upload your MM to the database.<br /><br /><b>How now?</b><br />Contact the Admin that you want to add MM to the GEDCOM. He will advise you which format is needed.<br />When you have the pictures in the right format, you can email them to the Admin.

"addmedia_tool_help";"~ADD MEDIA TOOL~<br />MySQL mode only</b><br /><br />The Add Media Tool was designed for users whose genealogy programs do not export GEDCOMs with Media links.  Family Tree Maker is the most notorious for this.  <br /><br />The Add Media Tool allows you to keep a list of media links outside of your GEDCOM file and seperate from the normal Genmod tables.  Because the data is kept in a seperate table,you only have to enter the data once.  This makes it easy for administrators to work with the genealogical data in their desktop program, export a new GEDCOM file, and then run Add Media tool on it as part of the import process to have the same image links added everytime they make a new GEDCOM.<br /><br />To use the Add Media Tool, first create a list a media items by filling the fields and clicking the Add Media button for each media item you want included in your GEDCOM.  The "#gm_lang[gedcomid]#" field contains the ID of the GEDCOM record you want the image added to, I100 for example.  In the "Exernal File" field, type in the filename of the image you want to use.  Enter the file's extension in the "#gm_lang[extension]#" field.  Use the "#gm_lang[highlighted]#" field to tell whether or not this image is the highlighted or primary image for this individual.  The first highlighted or primary image will be used on charts and highlighted on the individual page next to the person's name.  In the "#gm_lang[title]#" field enter a descriptive title or caption for the image.  Use the "#gm_lang[order]#" field to specify an the order the images should appear on the individual's media tab.  Finally, the "#gm_lang[gedcom_file]#" fields tells which GEDCOM the media item is for.  This allows you to use the tool with multiple GEDCOM files.<br /><br />When the list is completed, click on the "#gm_lang[click_to_add_media]#" button to have the changes stored in the GEDCOM file.  The next time you update your GEDCOM you only need to launch the Add Media Tool and click this button.<br /><br />"

You can also use regular expressions in your search if you are familiar with them.  For example, if you wanted to find all of the people who have dates in the 20th century, you could enter the search 19[0-9][0-9] and you would get all of the people with dates from 1900-1999.<br /><br />If you need more Help with this searching system, please let us know, so that we can extend this Help-file as well."

"soundex_search_help";"~SEARCH THE WAY YOU THINK THE NAME IS WRITTEN (SOUNDEX): ~<br /><br />The SOUNDEX name search is also rather powerful.<br />First a short explanation of Soundex:<br /><br />Soundex sorts together names that sound similar but have different spellings. A soundex code begins with the first letter of the name followed by a three-digit code that represents the first three remaining consonants. Zeros will be added to names that do not have enough letters to be coded.<br /><br />In plain English this means:<br />If you are searching for "Smith", you can get as result:<br />Smith - Smid - Smit - Schmidt, Smyth, Smithe, Smithee, Schmitt, Smead,  Sneed, Smoote etc.<br /><br />You don't have to worry about the Soundex codes.<br />Just type in the name that you ar looking for, and the program does the work.<br /><br />The Soundex system is very good to use: sometimes you know a name, but you don't know the exact spelling of it.<br />It can also happen that a mistake was made, by putting the name into the database.<br />Using the Soundex system, you will still be able to find the name.<br /><br />To get used to it, try to find a certain name, but type it in the search form in a different way.<br /><br />In this Soundex search form, any name is enough to start searching.<br />You can search on last name, given name or place name.<br />Filling in more than one field works like "AND".<br />You can also limit the search results by entering a year or year range. Examples are: 1950 or 19[5-7][0-9] which represents 1950 to 1979.<br />The search results will contain any individual with an event in the given place, in the given year range."
