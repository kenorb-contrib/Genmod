"hs_intro";"You can search Genmod's Help system.  The #gm_lang[hs_title]# feature gives you a high degree of control over the way the search functions; you should be able to find what you are looking for easily."
"hs_keyword_advice";"~#gm_lang[hs_keyword]#~<br />You enter the words or the phrase you wish to find.<br /><br />The search does not pay attention to the case (upper or lower) of the search terms or the text being examined.  This means that if you search for <b>Individual</b>, you will find text containing <b>Individual</b>, <b>individual</b>, or <b>INDIVIDUAL</b>.  You will also find text containing <b>individuals</b>, etc. since the search is looking for sequences of characters rather than words.<br /><br />You can have the search look for several words at once.  Enter all of the words, separating each of them by a space, like this: <b>individual&nbsp;family&nbsp;child</b>.  When more than one word is entered, the meaning of what you have typed is clarified in the #gm_lang[hs_searchhow]# field.<br />"
"hs_searchin_advice";"~#gm_lang[hs_searchin]#~<br />You determine the scope of the search here.<br /><br />Administrators have the choice of searching User Help or Configuration Help or both.  Users do not have this choice; because they do not have access to any configuration features, they can only search the User Help file.<br /><br />The Help files contain not only Help text but also certain text strings used to build input forms and other material.  This option lets you control whether the entire Help file should be examined or whether only the Help text should be looked at.<br />"
"hs_searchhow_advice";"~#gm_lang[hs_searchhow]#~<br />You clarify the meaning of what you have entered into the #gm_lang[hs_keyword]# field by selecting among the possibilities presented here.<br /><dl><dt><b>#gm_lang[hs_searchany]#</b></dt><dd>If you have entered <b>individual&nbsp;family&nbsp;child</b>, this option will find Help text that contains one of the words listed.

The meaning of the search is: "Find Help text containing the words <b>individual&nbsp;family&nbsp;child</b> in exactly that order with no other words or characters between".  You probably won't find this particular phrase in any Help text.<br /><br />There are a few limitations on this type of search.  Certain special characters such as <b>&quot; &lt; &gt;</b> etc. are contained within the Help text in symbolic form and won't be found if they form part of the text you enter.  Some Help text contains a special kind of Space character represented by <b>&amp;nbsp;</b> and you won't find phrases containing this character.</dd></dl>"
