This feature can be switched off by setting the time interval to 0.<br /><br />This sets $MAX_VIEWS and $MAX_VIEW_TIME in the <i>system configuration</i>.<br />"
"MEDIA_DIRECTORY_LEVELS_help";"~#gm_lang[MEDIA_DIRECTORY_LEVELS]#~<br /><br />A value of 0 will ignore all directories in the file path for the media object.  A value of 1 will retain the first directory containing this image.  Increasing the numbers increases number of parent directories to retain in the path.<br /><br />For example, if you link an image in your GEDCOM with a path like <b>C:\Documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;Settings\User\My&nbsp;Documents\My&nbsp;Pictures\Genealogy\Surname&nbsp;Line\grandpa.jpg</b>, a value of 0 will translate this path to <b>./media/grandpa.jpg</b>.  A value of 1 will translate this to <b>./media/Surname&nbsp;Line/grandpa.jpg</b>, etc.  Most people will only need to use a 0.  However, it is possible that some media objects kept in different directories have identical names and would overwrite each other when this option is set to 0.

"MEDIA_EXTERNAL_help";"~#gm_lang[MEDIA_EXTERNAL]#~<br /><br />When a multimedia link is found starting with for example http://, ftp://, mms:// it will not be altered when set to <b>Yes</b>. For example, http://www.myfamily.com/photo/dad.jpg will stay http://www.myfamily.com/photo/dad.jpg.  When set to <b>No</b>, the link will be handled as a standard reference and the media depth will be used.

"MERGE_DOUBLE_MEDIA_help";"~#gm_lang[MERGE_DOUBLE_MEDIA]#~<br /><br />Many genealogy programs export to gedcom format, embedding the media information in the individual, family or source records. Genmod by default splits that information off, stores it as multimedia records, and separately stores the pointers to that record. This makes it possible to use the same multimedia information in different places.<br /><br />With this setting you can choose what Genmod will do during the split off of the multimedia records.<br /><br /><b>Don't Merge</b> Means that all embedded media information will 1 to 1 generate separate multimedia records. As a result, it may be possible that multiple multimedia records are the same, because they were originally embedded in multiple persons, family or source records.<br /><br /><b>Merge based on filename</b> Means that Genmod will compare every new multimedia record with the ones already in the database. If a multimedia record, relating to the same file (picture) already exists, Genmod will NOT generate a new multimedia record, but just add a pointer to the existing one.<br /><br /><b>Merge based on filename and title</b> Means almost the same as the above option, except that Genmod will also check for the multimedia title.

"add_media_help";"~#gm_lang[add_media]#~<br /><br />Adding multimedia files (MM) to the GEDCOM is a very nice feature.  Although this program already has a great look without media, if you add pictures or other MM to your relatives, it will only get better.<br /><br /><b>What you should understand about MM.</b><br />There are many formats of MM. Although Genmod can handle most of them, there some things to consider.<br /><ul><li><b>Formats</b><br />Pictures can be edited and saved in many formats.  For example, .jpg, .png, .bmp, .gif, etc.  If the same original picture was used to create each of the formats, the viewed image will appear to be the same size no matter which format is used.  However, the image files stored in the database will vary considerably in size.  Generally, .jpg images are considered to the most efficient in terms of storage space.</li><br /><li><b>Image size</b><br />The larger the original image, the larger will be the resultant file's size. The picture should fit on the screen without scrolling; the maximum width or height should not be more than the width or height of the screen. Genmod is designed for screens of 1024x768 pixels but not all of this space is available for viewing pictures; the picture's size should be set accordingly.  To reduce file sizes, smaller pictures are more desirable.</li><br /><li><b>Resolution</b><br />The resolution of a picture is usually measured in "dpi" (dots/inch), but this is valid only for printed pictures.  When considering pictures shown on screen, the only correct way is to use total dots or pixels. When printed, the picture could have a resolution of 150 - 300 dpi or more depending on the printer. Screen resolutions are rarely better than 50 pixels per inch.  If your picture will never be printed, you can safely lower its resolution (and consequently its file size) without affecting picture quality.  If a low-resolution picture is printed with too great a magnification, its quality will suffer; it will have a grainy appearance.</li><br /><li><b>Color depth</b><br />Another way to keep a file small is to decrease the number of colors that you use.  The number of colors can differ from pure black and white (two colors) to true colors (millions of colors) and anything in between.  You can see that the more colors are used, the bigger the size of the files.</li></ul><b>Why is it important to keep the file size small?</b><br /><ul><li>First of all: Our webspace is limited.  The more large files there are, the more web space we need on the server. The more space we need, the higher our costs.</li><br /><li>Bandwidth.  The more data our server has to send to the remote location (your location), the more we have to pay.  This is because the carrying capacity of the server's connection to the Internet is limited, and the link has to be shared (and paid for) by all of the applications running on the server.  Genmod is one of many applications that share the server.  The cost is normally apportioned according to the amount of data each application sends and receives.</li><br /><li>Download time. If you have large files, the user (also you) will have to wait long for the page to download from the server.  Not everybody is blessed with a cable connection, broadband or DSL.</li></ul><b>How to upload your MM</b><br />There are two ways to upload media to the site.  If you have a lot of media items to upload you should contact the site administrator to discuss the best ways.  If it has been enabled by your site administrator, you can use the Upload Media form under your #gm_lang[mgv]# menu.  You can also use the Upload option on the Multimedia form to upload media items.<br /><br />"

"edit_PLAC_help";"~#factarray[PLAC]#~<br /><br />Places should be entered according to the standards for genealogy.  In genealogy, places are recorded with the most specific information about the place first and then working up to the least specific place last, using commas to separate the different place levels.  The level at which you record the place information should represent the levels of government or church where vital records for that place are kept.<br /><br />For example, a place like Salt Lake City would be entered as "Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah, USA".<br /><br />Let's examine each part of this place.  The first part, "Salt Lake City," is the city or township where the event occurred.  In some countries, there may be municipalities or districts inside a city which are important to note.  In that case, they should come before the city.  The next part, "Salt Lake," is the county.  "Utah" is the state, and "USA" is the country.  It is important to note each place because genealogical records are kept by the governments of each level.<br /><br />If a level of the place is unknown, you should leave a space between the commas.  Suppose, in the example above, you didn't know the county for Salt Lake City.  You should then record it like this: "Salt Lake City, , Utah, USA".  Suppose you only know that a person was born in Utah.  You would enter the information like this: ", , Utah, USA".  <br /><br />You can use the <b>#gm_lang[find_place]#</b> link to help you find places that already exist in the database.<br /><br />"

"lang_filenames_help";"~#gm_lang[lang_filenames]#~<br /><br />Genmod has implemented support for many different languages.  This has been achieved by keeping all text that is visible to users in files completely separate from the main program.  There is a set of five files for each supported language, and the various texts have been separated into one of these files according to function.  When a given text is not yet available in translated form, Genmod will use the English version.<br /><br />The files in each language set are:<br /><ul><li><b><i>configure_help.xx.php</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This file contains terms, common expressions, and Help text for use during configuration of Genmod.  The Help text is not intended to be viewed by ordinary users.</li><br /><li><b><i>countries.xx.php</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a list of country names, taken from the Web site of the Statistics Division, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.  This is the relevant <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49alpha.htm" target=_blank><b>link</b></a> to the English list.  The list is available in either English or French.</li><br /><li><b><i>facts.xx.php</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This file contains the textual equivalents of the GEDCOM Fact codes found in the GEDCOM 5.5.1 Standard.

Links to external multimedia files will be changed to references to the new multimedia record, which will in turn contain a reference to the external file. For example, the following GEDCOM record will be changed from:<blockquote><code>0 @I1@ INDI<br />1 NAME Your/Name/<br />1 OBJE<br />2 FORM jpg<br />2 FILE media/grandma.jpg<br />2 TITL Picture of grandma</code></blockquote>to:<blockquote><code>0 @I1@ INDI<br />1 NAME Your/Name/<br />1 OBJE @M1@<br /></code></blockquote>The advantage of using multimedia records is that you can easily administer your media.

"soundex_search_help";"~SEARCH THE WAY YOU THINK THE NAME IS WRITTEN (SOUNDEX)~<br /><br />The Soundex name search is also very powerful.<br /><br />First a short explanation of Soundex:<br /><br />Soundex sorts together names that sound similar but have different spellings. A Soundex code begins with the first letter of the name followed by a three-digit code that represents the first three remaining consonants <u>without</u> diacritical marks. Consonants with diacritical marks are ignored.  The numerical value assigned to each consonant depends on its sound in English.  For instance, <b>c</b>, <b>k</b>, <b>q</b>, and <b>x</b> have the same value because they sound the same.  Likewise, <b>b</b> and <b>p</b> have the same sound value as do <b>c</b>, <b>s</b> and <b>z</b>.  Zeros are added to names that do not have enough consonants to be coded.<br /><br />In simple terms this means:<br />If you are searching for <b>Smith</b>, you might find <b>Smith, Smid, Smit, Schmidt, Smyth, Smithe, Smithee, Schmitt, Smead, Sneed, Smoote</b> etc.  You'll even find a names like <b>Sammett</b>, <b>Shand</b>, or <b>Snoddy</b> when you're looking for <b>Smith</b>.  That's surprising, but true; the test was done on a real live database with these names in it.<br /><br />You don't have to worry about the Soundex codes.  Just type in the name that you are looking for, and Genmod does the work.<br /><br />The Soundex system is very good to use: sometimes you know a name, but you don't know the exact spelling of it.  Sometimes names are entered into the database incorrectly.  You will still be able to find the name when you use a Soundex search.<br /><br />To become more familiar with this search method, try to find a name that you know exists in the database, but type it into the Soundex search form in a different way.<br /><br />In this Soundex search form, any name is enough to start searching.  You can search on Last name, Given name, or Place name.  When more than one field is filled in, the search terms are combined in an <b>AND</b> relationship.<br /><br />You can further limit the search results by entering a year or year range. For example, <b>1950</b> or <b>19[5-7][0-9]</b>.  This latter entry is a "regular expression" that represents a year range <b>1950 to 1979</b>.  This regular expression is decoded as follows: <ol><li>find the digit <b>1</b></li><li>following that "find", find the digit <b>9</b></li><li>following those two "finds", find a character matching what's inside the square brackets.  These brackets contain a list; in this case it's a list of digits in the range <b>5</b> to <b>7</b>.</li><li>When the above conditions have been satisfied, look for another character to match the contents of the last pair of square brackets.  Again, this is a list, this time of the digits <b>0</b> through <b>9</b>.</li></ol>The search results will contain any individual with an event in the given place, in the given year range.<br /><br />"

English usually defines the time format as <b>g:i:sa</b> to produce a display like <b>9:01:25am</b>.<br /><br />In the 24-hour system, midnight is 00:00.  In the 12-hour system, midnight is 12:00am and noon is 12:00pm.<br />"
