This allows you to see all of the information that was obtained from a particular repository.<br /><br />If enabled by the site admin, you will have one or two more menu icons on this page:<br /><b>#gm_lang[view_gedcom]#</b>, which shows the information in GEDCOM format.<br /><b>#gm_lang[add_to_cart]#</b>, which enables you to store this information in your #gm_lang[clip_cart]#.

"help_repolist.php";"~#gm_lang[repo_list]#~<br /><br />A list of repositories is displayed on this page.<br /><br />The names of the repositories are sorted into alphabetical order.<br /><br /><b>REPOSITORIES</b><br />Without repositories we cannot build our database. There is a source for all information stored in the database, and that source is kept in a repository. Repositories can be the personal archive of a person, an institution, a public database, a government or church records office, an Internet resource, etc. To get access to a source we will want to know where and in what place it is.

"help_reportengine.php";"~REPORTS~<br />The items in the reports menu will generate PDF files for printing.<br /><br />The first step is to choose a report to run.  After you have selected a report to run, you will be asked to provide some information specific to that report, such as which individual or family to start with and whether or not to show photos.  When you are ready to run the report, click the <b>#gm_lang[download_report]#</b> button to download the report to your computer.<br /><br /><br />#gm_lang[help_xml_reports]#<br />#gm_lang[def_pdf_format_help]#<br />#gm_lang[help_ahnentafel.xml]#<br />#gm_lang[help_birthlist.xml]#<br />#gm_lang[help_relativelist.xml]#"
"help_search.php";"~THE SEARCH PAGE~<br /><br />Although this page looks very simple, there is a very powerful and complicated search engine behind the two forms.  Most genealogy web sites just let you search for a name.  Genmod lets you search for almost anything.<br /><br />The Search box on the left of the screen is the same as the Search box in each page header.<br /><br />If you are looking for people in connection to a certain year, just type the year. The program will find all connections for you.<br /><br />Looking for a name, or place?  Just type in the name or place, completely or just a part of it, and Genmod does the rest.<br /><br /><b>Soundex search method</b><br />With the search boxes on the right, you can search for names of persons and places, even if you don't know precisely how to write the name.<br /><br />When there are several genealogical databases on one site and the administrator has enabled switching between them, your search will return the results for all of them.<br /><br />You will find more help about these two boxes by clicking the <b>?</b> above the boxes.<br /><br />"
"help_source.php";"~SOURCE DETAILS PAGE~<br /><br />The details of the source are displayed on this page. Sources are very important to genealogical researchers and will allow you to follow the trail another researcher used to find the information.<br /><br />You can see information about the source's title, author, publication, and the repository where the source was looked up. Because of the many different types of sources, some sources may have more information than others.<br /><br />If a multimedia object such as a scan of a document is connected to the source, you can view that object by clicking the object. When you click on the object name, you will see the object on the #gm_lang[media_list]# page.<br /><br />Following the source details there is a list of all individuals and families who are connected to this source. This allows you to identify all items that were obtained from that data source.<br /><br />When the administrator has enabled these features, you will have one or two additional menu icons on this page:<ol><li><b>#gm_lang[view_gedcom]#</b><br />which shows the information in GEDCOM format.</li><br /><li><b>#gm_lang[add_to_cart]#</b><br />which enables you to store this information in your #gm_lang[clip_cart]# for later downloading and importing into your own genealogy program.</li></ol><br />#gm_lang[context_help]#<br /><br />"
"help_sourcelist.php";"~SOURCES LIST PAGE~<br /><br />A list of sources is displayed on this page.<br /><br />Unlike the #gm_lang[indi_info]# and Family pages, there is no alphabetical index.<br /><br />A source can be an individual, a public database, an institution, an Internet resource, etc.  Because of the completely random nature of genealogical sources, it is impossible to find a sort order that is meaningful in all cases. However, Genmod <u>does</u> sort the Source names into alphabetical order.<br /><br /><b>SOURCES</b><br />Without sources we cannot build our database. There is a source for every item of information in the database. The source can be a relative, an institution, a public database, government or private records, an Internet resource, etc.<br /><br />A source can be linked to many persons. One person can also be linked to many sources. You can have different sources for every event, whether it is birth date, profession, marriage, children, etc.<br /><br />"
"help_timeline.php";"~TIME LINE PAGE~<br /><br />On this page you can display one or more persons along a timeline.  You can, for example, visualize the status of two or more persons at a certain moment.<br /><br />If you click the <b>Time Line</b> link on an other page you already see one person on the Time Line.  If you clicked the <b>Time Line</b> menu item in a page header, you have to supply the starting person's ID.<br /><br />"
"help_uploadmedia.php";"~UPLOAD MEDIA FILES~<br /><br />Uploading media files is quite straightforward.  Here is a little additional information.<br /><br /><b>Thumbnails</b><br />Thumbnails should have a size somewhere around 100px width.  The thumbnail <u>must</u> be named identically to the full-size version.  If your system can generate thumbnails automatically, you will see a notice to that effect on the Upload Media page.<br /><br /><b>Uploading</b><br />Files will be uploaded automatically to the directory ../media for the full-sized version and to ../media/thumbs/ for the thumbnails.<br /><br />#gm_lang[readme_help]#"
"help_xml_reports";"~Reporting Engine~<br />The Genmod Reporting Engine uses XML template files to automatically generate PDF reports.<br /><br />The reports available in the <b>#gm_lang[select_report]#</b> list are generated from the report XML files found in the "reports" directory.  You can create your own reports by making a copy of any of the templates provided and modifying the template XML.  To add your custom report, just put it in the "reports" directory and Genmod will automatically detect it and make it available in the <b>#gm_lang[select_report]#</b> drop-down list.<br /><br />"
