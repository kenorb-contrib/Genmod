"edit_PLAC_help";"~#factarray[PLAC]#~<br /><br />Places should be entered according to the standards for genealogy.  In genealogy, places are recorded with the most specific information about the place first and then working up to the least specific place last, using commas to separate the different place levels.  The level at which you record the place information should represent the levels of government or church where vital records for that place are kept.<br /><br />For example, a place like Salt Lake City would be entered as "Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah, USA".<br /><br />Let's examine each part of this place.  The first part, "Salt Lake City," is the city or township where the event occurred.  In some countries, there may be municipalities or districts inside a city which are important to note.  In that case, they should come before the city.  The next part, "Salt Lake," is the county.  "Utah" is the state, and "USA" is the country.  It is important to note each place because genealogical records are kept by the governments of each level.<br /><br />If a level of the place is unknown, you should leave a space between the commas.  Suppose, in the example above, you didn't know the county for Salt Lake City.  You should then record it like this: "Salt Lake City, , Utah, USA".  Suppose you only know that a person was born in Utah.  You would enter the information like this: ", , Utah, USA".  <br /><br />You can use the <b>#gm_lang[find_place]#</b> link to help you find places that already exist in the database.<br /><br />"

"rss_feed_help";"~RSS FEED SETTINGS~<br /><br />The RSS feed available in Genmod allows you to view the main contents of your welcome page from you favorite RSS feed aggregator without visiting the site. Most aggregators will pop up a notice letting you know when something has changed on the Index page. This essentially allows you to monitor a Genmod site without needing to visit it regularly. With the RSS Feed block you customize the link to the feed, allowing specific feed types (most readers can deal with most types so this can usually be left at the default), and the specific module you would like in your feed. The language of the feed will be based on the language active in Genmod when you select the feed. The types of feed that can be generated include RSS 0.92, RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, ATOM, HTML and JavaScript. The first 4 types are for feed aggregators, while JavaScript and HTML are meant to enable inclusion of the feeds in other web pages.<br /><br />Note that the various version numbers of the RSS feed indicate different styles, not a different version.<br /><br />"

"def_gedcom_help";"~GEDCOM file~<br />A quote from the Introduction to the GEDCOM 5.5.1 Standard:<div class="list_value_wrap">GEDCOM was developed by the Family History Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to provide a flexible, uniform format for exchanging computerized genealogical data.&nbsp; GEDCOM is an acronym for <i><b>GE</b></i>nealogical <i><b>D</b></i>ata <i><b>Com</b></i>munication.&nbsp; Its purpose is to foster the sharing of genealogical information and the development of a wide range of inter-operable software products to assist genealogists, historians, and other researchers.</div><br />A copy of the GEDCOM 5.5.1 <u>draft</u> Standard, to which Genmod adheres, can be downloaded in PDF format here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.Genmod.net/ged551-5.pdf" target=_blank>GEDCOM 5.5.1 Standard</a>  This Standard is only available in English.<br /><br />The GEDCOM file contains all the information about the family.&nbsp; All facts, dates, events, etc. are stored here.&nbsp; GEDCOM files have to follow strict rules because they must be exchangeable between many programs, independent of platforms or operating systems.<br /><br />"
"def_gedcom_date_help";"~Dates in a GEDCOM file~<br />Although the date field allows for free-form entry (meaning you can type in whatever you want), there are some rules about how dates should be entered according to the GEDCOM 5.5.1 standard.<ol><li>A full date is entered in the form DD MMM YYYY.  For example, <b>01&nbsp;Mar&nbsp;1801</b> or <b>14&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;1950</b>.</li><li>If you are missing a part of the date, you can omit that part.  E.g. <b>Mar&nbsp;1801</b> or <b>14&nbsp;Dec</b>.</li><li>If you are not sure or the date is not confirmed, you could enter <b>abt&nbsp;Mar&nbsp;1801</b> (abt = about), <b>bef&nbsp;20&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;1950</b> (bef = before), <b>aft&nbsp;1949</b> (aft = after)</li></ol><b>Be sure to enter dates and abbreviations in <u>English</u>,</b> because then the GEDCOM file is exchangeable and Genmod can translate all dates and abbreviations properly into the currently active language.  Furthermore, Genmod does calculations using these dates. If improper dates are entered into date fields, Genmod will not be able to calculate properly.<br /><br />You can click on the Calendar icon for help selecting a date.<br /><br />"
"def_gm_help";"~Genmod~<br />Genmod (or GM) does not just put static pages on the Web; it is dynamic and can be customized in many ways.<br /><br />Genmod was created by John Finlay to view GEDCOM files online.  John started developing the program on his own.  An international team of developers and translators has since joined him and is working to improve the program.  Among the more significant features that have been added or improved in the program are its extensive support of languages other than English, and the ability to add and edit events online.<br /><br />"
"def_theme_help";"~Theme~<br />This site can have different "appearances", called Themes.<br /><br />The site administrator chooses a default Theme, which everybody who enters this site will initially see. When the administrator has enabled this feature, all users can select their own Themes.  Genmod remembers the last selected Theme for each logged-in user, so that that user will automatically see that Theme the next time he logs in.  Themes can be used as a way to distinguish between different databases on the same site.  Each database can have a different default Theme.<br /><br />"

"show_full_help";"~HIDE  OR  SHOW  DETAILS~<br /><br />With this option you can either show or hide all details in the Name boxes.  You can display more boxes on one screen when the details are hidden.<br /><br />When all details are hidden, the Zoom icon described below is not shown.  However, if the administrator has enabled the Zoom function, the entire box will act like a Zoom icon to reveal full details about the person.<br /><br />When the details are not hidden and the Zoom function, identified by a magnifying glass icon, has been enabled by the administrator, you can reveal even more details about that person.  If you normally have to click on the Zoom icon to zoom in, you can reveal additional hidden details by clicking that icon here.

"soundex_search_help";"~SEARCH THE WAY YOU THINK THE NAME IS WRITTEN (SOUNDEX)~<br /><br />The Soundex name search is also very powerful.<br /><br />First a short explanation of Soundex:<br /><br />Soundex sorts together names that sound similar but have different spellings. A Soundex code begins with the first letter of the name followed by a three-digit code that represents the first three remaining consonants <u>without</u> diacritical marks. Consonants with diacritical marks are ignored.  The numerical value assigned to each consonant depends on its sound in English.  For instance, <b>c</b>, <b>k</b>, <b>q</b>, and <b>x</b> have the same value because they sound the same.  Likewise, <b>b</b> and <b>p</b> have the same sound value as do <b>c</b>, <b>s</b> and <b>z</b>.  Zeros are added to names that do not have enough consonants to be coded.<br /><br />In simple terms this means:<br />If you are searching for <b>Smith</b>, you might find <B>Smith, Smid, Smit, Schmidt, Smyth, Smithe, Smithee, Schmitt, Smead, Sneed, Smoote</b> etc.  You'll even find a names like <b>Sammett</b>, <b>Shand</b>, or <b>Snoddy</b> when you're looking for <b>Smith</b>.  That's surprising, but true; the test was done on a real live database with these names in it.<br /><br />You don't have to worry about the Soundex codes.  Just type in the name that you are looking for, and Genmod does the work.<br /><br />The Soundex system is very good to use: sometimes you know a name, but you don't know the exact spelling of it.  Sometimes names are entered into the database incorrectly.  You will still be able to find the name when you use a Soundex search.<br /><br />To become more familiar with this search method, try to find a name that you know exists in the database, but type it into the Soundex search form in a different way.<br /><br />In this Soundex search form, any name is enough to start searching.  You can search on Last name, Given name, or Place name.  When more than one field is filled in, the search terms are combined in an <b>AND</b> relationship.<br /><br />You can further limit the search results by entering a year or year range. For example, <b>1950</b> or <b>19[5-7][0-9]</b>.  This latter entry is a "regular expression" that represents a year range <b>1950 to 1979</b>.  This regular expression is decoded as follows: <ol><li>find the digit <b>1</b></li><li>following that "find", find the digit <b>9</b></li><li>following those two "finds", find a character matching what's inside the square brackets.  These brackets contain a list; in this case it's a list of digits in the range <b>5</b> to <b>7</b>.</li><li>When the above conditions have been satisfied, look for another character to match the contents of the last pair of square brackets.  Again, this is a list, this time of the digits <b>0</b> through <b>9</b>.</li></ol>The search results will contain any individual with an event in the given place, in the given year range.<br /><br />"

"add_media_help";"~#gm_lang[add_media]#~<br /><br />Adding multimedia files (MM) to the GEDCOM is a very nice feature.  Although this program already has a great look without media, if you add pictures or other MM to your relatives, it will only get better.<br /><br /><b>What you should understand about MM.</b><br />There are many formats of MM. Although Genmod can handle most of them, there some things to consider.<br /><ul><li><b>Formats</b><br />Pictures can be edited and saved in many formats.  For example, .jpg, .png, .bmp, .gif, etc.  If the same original picture was used to create each of the formats, the viewed image will appear to be the same size no matter which format is used.  However, the image files stored in the database will vary considerably in size.  Generally, .jpg images are considered to the most efficient in terms of storage space.</li><br /><li><b>Image size</b><br />The larger the original image, the larger will be the resultant file's size. The picture should fit on the screen without scrolling; the maximum width or height should not be more than the width or height of the screen. Genmod is designed for screens of 1024x768 pixels but not all of this space is available for viewing pictures; the picture's size should be set accordingly.  To reduce file sizes, smaller pictures are more desirable.</li><br /><li><b>Resolution</b><br />The resolution of a picture is usually measured in "dpi" (dots/inch), but this is valid only for printed pictures.  When considering pictures shown on screen, the only correct way is to use total dots or pixels. When printed, the picture could have a resolution of 150 - 300 dpi or more depending on the printer. Screen resolutions are rarely better than 50 pixels per inch.  If your picture will never be printed, you can safely lower its resolution (and consequently its file size) without affecting picture quality.  If a low-resolution picture is printed with too great a magnification, its quality will suffer; it will have a grainy appearance.</li><br /><li><b>Color depth</b><br />Another way to keep a file small is to decrease the number of colors that you use.  The number of colors can differ from pure black and white (two colors) to true colors (millions of colors) and anything in between.  You can see that the more colors are used, the bigger the size of the files.</li></ul><b>Why is it important to keep the file size small?</b><br /><ul><li>First of all: Our webspace is limited.  The more large files there are, the more web space we need on the server. The more space we need, the higher our costs.</li><br /><li>Bandwidth.  The more data our server has to send to the remote location (your location), the more we have to pay.  This is because the carrying capacity of the server's connection to the Internet is limited, and the link has to be shared (and paid for) by all of the applications running on the server.  Genmod is one of many applications that share the server.  The cost is normally apportioned according to the amount of data each application sends and receives.</li><br /><li>Download time. If you have large files, the user (also you) will have to wait long for the page to download from the server.  Not everybody is blessed with a cable connection, broadband or DSL.</li></ul><b>How to upload your MM</b><br />There are two ways to upload media to the site.  If you have a lot of media items to upload you should contact the site administrator to discuss the best ways.  If it has been enabled by your site administrator, you can use the Upload Media form under your #gm_lang[mgv]# menu.  You can also use the Upload option on the Multimedia form to upload media items.<br /><br />"

The eighth month is called "August" in German.<br /><br />In Hungarian, the format normally is <b>Y.&nbsp;M&nbsp;D.</b> producing <b>1965.&nbsp;augusztus&nbsp;20.</b> when displayed by Genmod.  In Hungarian, month names do not have an initial capital letter, and the eighth month is called "augusztus".</li><br /><li><b>Alternative format</b><br />To show dates in special ways not handled by the <b>Standard format</b>, use these codes:<br /><b>d</b> - day of the month, 2 digits, leading zero; i.e. <b>01</b> to <b>31</b><br /><b>D</b> - day of the week, textual, 3 letters; e.g. <b>Fri</b><br /><b>F</b> - month, textual, long; e.g. <b>January</b><br /><b>j</b> - day of the month, no leading zeros; i.e. <b>1</b> to <b>31</b><br /><b>l</b> (lowercase "L") - day of the week, textual, long; e.g. <b>Friday</b><br /><b>M</b> - month, textual, 3 letters; e.g. <b>Jan</b><br /><b>Y</b> - year, 4 digits; e.g. <b>1999</b><br /><b>R</b> - French Revolutionary format (see note)<br /><b>y</b> - year, 2 digits; e.g. <b>99</b><br /><br />For example, the date format <b>D&nbsp;j&nbsp;F&nbsp;Y</b> could result in <b>Thu&nbsp;9&nbsp;January&nbsp;1806</b> while the same date displayed according to the formula <b>l&nbsp;d&nbsp;M&nbsp;Y</b> would result in <b>Thursday&nbsp;09&nbsp;Jan&nbsp;1806</b></li><br /><li><b>French Revolutionary format</b><br />The format code <b>R</b> works in all languages, but produces output when the date is in the range 1792.09.22 to 1805.12.31.  The <b>R</b> code produces only French text, and the order of Day, Month, and Year cannot be changed. The output of the <b>R</b> formatting code is underlined to distinguish it from the regular date.  <br /><br />The <b>R</b> formatting code is considered to be normal text when the date format contains only <b>D</b>, <b>M</b>, and <b>Y</b> codes as described in the topic <b>Standard format</b> above.  In other words, for the <b>R</b> code to be recognized, the date format needs to contain a code from the <b>Alternative format</b> list that doesn't appear in the <b>Standard format</b> list.<br /><br />For example, the date format <b>D&nbsp;M&nbsp;Y&nbsp;R</b> will produce <b>13&nbsp;October&nbsp;1797&nbsp;R</b> in English for the date 1797.10.13. If, on the other hand, the date format were <b>j&nbsp;F&nbsp;Y&nbsp;R</b>, the same date would result in <b>13&nbsp;October&nbsp;1797&nbsp;<u>22&nbsp;Vendemiaire&nbsp;An&nbsp;6</u></b> in English.</li></ul>"
