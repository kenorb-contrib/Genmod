 * Individual List
 *
 * Genmod: Genealogy Viewer
 * Copyright (C) 2005 - 2012 Genmod Development Team
 *
 * The individual list shows all individuals from a chosen gedcom file. The list is
 * setup in two sections. The alphabet bar and the details.
 *
 * The alphabet bar shows all the available letters users can click. The bar is built
 * up from the lastnames first letter. Added to this bar is the symbol @, which is
 * shown as a translated version of the variable <var>gm_lang["NN"]</var>, and a
 * translated version of the word ALL by means of variable <var>GM_LANG_allGM_LANG_</var>.
 *
 * The details can be shown in two ways, with surnames or without surnames. By default
 * the user first sees a list of surnames of the chosen letter and by clicking on a
 * surname a list with names of people with that chosen surname is displayed.
 *
 * Beneath the details list is the option to skip the surname list or show it.
 * Depending on the current status of the list.
